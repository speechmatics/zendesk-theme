# Getting Started

## Installing ZAT

You will need Zendesk Apps Tools to run this locally. On a Windows machine this will require running Ruby through the Ubuntu CLI in Windows Terminal.

Zendesk's instructions for this can be found below:

> The path to your local version of the theme will be similar to:
```
/mnt/c/Users/$UserName/Documents/Docs/KB/ZDTheme
```

> When you start the theme and have to enter the token, this will not be displayed in your terminal as you type or copy/paste
